A program updates variables in memory according to its instructions. Variables come in typesâ€”a
type is a classification of data that spells out possible values for that type and the operations that
can be performed on it.

The width of these types is the number of bits of storage a corresponding variable takes in memory. For example, 

> Most implementations of C++ use 32 or 64 bits for an int.
> In Java an int is always 32 bits.
